# Sigrok Decoder

This directory contains a custom Madelink protocol decoder for sigrok based logic analyzers.

The decoder decodes Madelink protocol messages and shows the COBS decoded payloads.

You can configure custom property names and decoders by adding a python script in the sub_decoder directory.
